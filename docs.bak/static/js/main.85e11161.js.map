The polling providers\n *  will stall responses to ensure a consistent state, while this\n *  WebSocket provider assumes the connected backend will manage this.\n *\n *  For example, if a polling provider emits an event which indicates\n *  the event occurred in blockhash XXX, a call to fetch that block by\n *  its hash XXX, if not present will retry until it is present. This\n *  can occur when querying a pool of nodes that are mildly out of sync\n *  with each other.\n */\n\nlet NextId = 1;\n\nexport type InflightRequest = {\n     callback: (error: Error, result: any) => void;\n     payload: string;\n};\n\nexport type Subscription = {\n    tag: string;\n    processFunc: (payload: any) => void;\n};\n\nexport interface WebSocketLike {\n    onopen: (...args: Array<any>) => any;\n    onmessage: (...args: Array<any>) => any;\n    onerror: (...args: Array<any>) => any;\n\n    readyState: number;\n\n    send(payload: any): void;\n    close(code?: number, reason?: string): void;\n}\n\n// For more info about the Real-time Event API see:\n//   https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub\n\nexport class WebSocketProvider extends JsonRpcProvider {\n    readonly _websocket: any;\n    readonly _requests: { [ name: string ]: InflightRequest };\n    readonly _detectNetwork: Promise<Network>;\n\n    // Maps event tag to subscription ID (we dedupe identical events)\n    readonly _subIds: { [ tag: string ]: Promise<string> };\n\n    // Maps Subscription ID to Subscription\n    readonly _subs: { [ name: string ]: Subscription };\n\n    _wsReady: boolean;\n\n    constructor(url: string | WebSocketLike, network?: Networkish) {\n\n        // This will be added in the future;
